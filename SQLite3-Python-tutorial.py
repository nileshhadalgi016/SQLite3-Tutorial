# what is Database ??

"""
- A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data,
typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled
by a database management system (DBMS). Together, the data and the DBMS, along with
the applications that are associated with them, are referred to as a database system,
often shortened to just database.

Data within the most common types of databases in operation today is typically
modeled in rows and columns in a series of tables to make processing and data querying
efficient. The data can then be easily accessed, managed, modified, updated, controlled,
and organized. Most databases use structured query language (SQL) for writing and querying data.

# What is Structured Query Language (SQL)?
"""

- SQL is a programming language used by nearly all relational databases to query,
manipulate, and define data, and to provide access control. SQL was first developed
at IBM in the 1970s with Oracle as a major contributor, which led to implementation
of the SQL ANSI standard, SQL has spurred many extensions from companies such as IBM,
Oracle, and Microsoft. Although SQL is still widely used today, new programming languages
are beginning to appear.
